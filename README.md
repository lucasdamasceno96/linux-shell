# Linux Scripts, Aliases, and Automations

This repository is a collection of **Linux scripts**, custom **aliases**, and **automations** I’ve created to streamline and simplify tasks related to my work as a Cloud Analyst. It also serves as a personal study project, helping me explore and practice scripting, automation, and optimization in Linux environments.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Scripts for Task Automation**  
  Automate repetitive tasks, enhance productivity, and minimize errors in daily workflows.
  
- **Custom Aliases**  
  Simplify complex commands and improve the efficiency of terminal usage.
  
- **Study and Experimentation**  
  Explore and experiment with Linux shell scripting, tools, and advanced CLI techniques.

- **Support for Private Cloud Environments**  
  Focused on scenarios encountered in managing Kubernetes clusters, handling support incidents, and creating infrastructure automation.
